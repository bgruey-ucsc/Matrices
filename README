		Matrix Library!

INTRODUCTION

Started as a C library to solve a generalized eigenvalue problem,
numerical approximations to quantum systems:

	[H] * [C] = E * [S] * [C]

where brackets indicate matrices:

	H is the Mamiltonian
	C is the basis function coefficient matrix
	S is the generalized "______" matrix for non-orthogonal basis
	  functions it would be the identity matrix if they were
	  orthogonal this matrix should be symmetric

The work started with the infinite square well approximation defined
on page 29 of Jos Thijssen's second edition of Computational Physics

This code will likely not erase your harddrive, but I make no
guarantees.
