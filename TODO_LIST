    Thoughts on next steps in the project, rather than littering them
	throughout the gitlogs.


1.  lib/mtx_transpose.c: Transpose API
	- Currently uses pass by reference to alter the given matrix
	- It should take a matrix pointer, and return its transpose
	- Can we make another function, same name, that takes a **matrix?
	    This one would alter the given matrix.
	    Should this function go in the same file, since they are effectively
	    the same function, same name?

2.  typedef
	- Haven't implemented this yet.
	- This would alter every file, though *should* be simple to do.

3.  LU Decomposition
	- New function, though can be computationally similar to mtx_rref.c's algorithm.
	- Could be useful for deciding if the determinant of the given matrix is zero.
	- Also probably other stuff.

4.  QR Decomposition for Eigen-work
	- http://www.math.umn.edu/~olver/num_/lnqr.pdf
	- An example with the numerics alongside the algorithm
	- May work better than the householder definition I was using in Thijssen.
	- Value and vector, that's everything we'd need!
